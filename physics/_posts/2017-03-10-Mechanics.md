# Introductory Mechanics
Before tackling Kleppner, review Shankar's' "Fundamentals of Physics" book and online course.
Here we are looking at mechanics using the Newton's original formulation.

> From David Morin's home page: "This book (the blue book) is written for a more general audience than Introduction to Classical Mechanics (the red book). The blue-book problems are similar to the one-star and two-star problems in the red book. The red book contains many harder problems and more advanced topics. The blue book can be viewed as a stepping stone to the red book."

# Classical Mechanics
Here, in addition to looking at the Newtonian formulation in greater depth, two important alternative formulations of classical mechanics are introduced: Lagrangian mechanics and Hamiltonian mechanics.

+ [*Introduction to Classical Mechanics: With Problems and Solutions*](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Classical-Mechanics-Problems-Solutions/dp/0521876222), David Morin, 2008. "The Red Book"
  + A complaint sometimes seen about the problems in Morin's' book is that their solutions often involve what seem like tricks. He does things like take advantage of symmetry or use small angle approxminations for trig functions, etc. While this can frustrate some, especially those self-studying, it does prepare you to think like a physicist armed with a lot of tools for solving problems.
