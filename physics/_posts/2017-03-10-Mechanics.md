# Intermediate Mechanics (2nd or 3rd year)

[Introduction to Classical Mechanics: With Problems and Solutions 1st Edition](http://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Classical-Mechanics-Problems-Solutions/dp/0521876222)
by David Morin

[Problems and Solutions in Introductory Mechanics](http://www.amazon.com/Problems-Solutions-Introductory-Mechanics-David/dp/1482086921) – Aug 14 2014
by David J. Morin

From David Morin's home page: "This book (the blue book) is written for a more general audience than Introduction to Classical Mechanics (the red book). The blue-book problems are similar to the one-star and two-star problems in the red book. The red book contains many harder problems and more advanced topics. The blue book can be viewed as a stepping stone to the red book."
