# Lists

## Ordered Lists

These are a bunch of ordered list items:
1. Do something.

2. Do something else.

    1. If the reverse-Pi separation gauge is set to `OFF` you can follow
       the following procedure.

        1. Use the flux capacitor on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays

        2. Do not use the flux capacitor if it's raining


    2. If the reverse-Pi separation gauge is set to `ON` then you
       should follow Procedure 42.

3. Go back to doing things

## Unordered Lists

These are a bunch of unordered list items:
* item 1
  + item 2
    - item 3

# Equations

Kevin $$\infty$$ was here

We want to solve:

$$\int \frac{1}{x}\ dx$$

Using integration by parts, whose formula is:

$$\int u\ dv=uv-\int v\ du$$

We substitute $$u=\frac {1}{x}\ $$, $$du=-\frac{1}{x^2}\ dx$$ and $$dv=dx$$, $$v=x$$ into the formula and find:

$$= \frac {1}{x}\ x-\int x \left(  -\frac {1}{x^2}\ dx\right)$$

And we've now arrived at the second paradox that micromass explains in his Insight:

$$\int \frac{1}{x}\ dx = 1 + \int \frac{1}{x}\ dx$$


$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{aligned}
$$
